DOT Problems
============

A simple web app to make reporting problems to Maine's DoT easier.

The Problem
-----------

The Maine DOT's website has a form to report a problem that is useful but not as user-friendly as it could be.  This is the form for my region: http://www.maine.gov/mdot/comments/rp/region4.htm  

As you can see, it simply says, "In the text box below, describe the problem you would like to report, and we will address it appropriately."  While this method certainly works, it would be far easier to incorporate geospatial features such as a map or even a mobile app that will upload geotags as to the location of the problem.  

Perhaps resources such as openstreetmaps.org, ESRI, or others can be of use.
